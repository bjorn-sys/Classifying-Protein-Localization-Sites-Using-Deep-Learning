# Classifying-Protein-Localization-Sites-Using-Deep-Learning
A PyTorch-based project for predicting protein localization sites in yeast using deep learning. The repository explores regularization techniques like L2 weight decay and Dropout to improve generalization in multiclass classification tasks. Includes a Streamlit web app for interactive predictions from user-input features.
